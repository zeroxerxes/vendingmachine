            		<p></p><h3>What are Vending Machines?</h3>Vending machines are like large, refrigerated cabinets that you plug into the mains. Newer models are designed to consume very little electricity, whilst keeping the drinks and snacks inside them cold.<p></p><p>Often found in public spaces like hospitals, train stations, airports, shopping centres and schools, vending machines can be used to dispense a variety of products like hot drinks, cold drinks, crisps, chocolate and confectionary. Each product inside the machine will be numbered or listed on the menu and customers must simply select the item they want using the touchpad or screen. Once payment has been completed, either by inserting the right amount of coins or via card or contactless payment, the machine’s dispensing motor will activate, causing the machine to retrieve the requested item and deliver it to the customer.<br></p><p>Different types of vending machines have different types of keypads or touchpads and will accept different kinds of payment methods. It’s important to choose a modern machine that enables convenient usage and payment.<br></p><p>Vending machines can be used to generate additional income but can equally be set to ‘free vend’, should you wish to provide certain products for free. <a href="get-a-free-quote.html" title="">Speak to the experts</a> at Best Vending to discuss your options further.<br></p>

            		<p>Vending machines are incredibly convenient, which explains their popularity. Available 24/7, they provide people with easy access to the drinks and snacks that they want whilst they’re on the go, ensuring that they don’t have to go hungry or thirsty just to get things done. But what other benefits do vending machines provide?</p><p></p><ul><li><b>They’re versatile:</b> Vending machines can be filled with all kinds of snacks and drinks, from fizzy cans and bottles to water, teas and coffees, crisps, chocolate and cereal bars. You could even use them to dispense non-food items like toiletries and headphones, depending on the essential items that people on your premises might need.</li><li><b>They’re easy to manage:</b> When you have vending machines, you won’t need to keep your café open beyond regular operating hours, meaning you won’t have to pay staff or consume electricity and other resources to provide people with the catering options they need. What’s more, when you choose a fully managed vending provider like Best Vending, you won’t even need to restock your machine, as we’ll monitor stock and refill them for you.</li><li><b>They’re profitable:</b> Vending machines require minimal maintenance and operating costs, allowing you to generate a steady stream of income with relatively little effort. This makes them a great decision for business owners looking for a low-risk, high-return investment. You can even rent our machines, allowing you to turn an immediate profit for a small monthly price.</li></ul><p></p><p>To learn more about how vending machines could benefit you, why not read our <a href="../blog.html" title="">blogs</a>?<br></p><p><br></p>

		<div class="column full">
            		<p>Vending machines are incredibly convenient, ensuring that people have constant, reliable access to the drinks and snacks they need at any time – day or night. Indeed, they’re a great way to boost your regular income from money that would otherwise be spent elsewhere, without having to run a costly café around the clock. As such, you’ll want to make sure they remain in good condition, making any necessary repairs as quickly as possible to avoid unhappy customers and potential profit loss.</p><p>At Best Vending, we only supply the highest quality vending machines to help to prevent breakdowns. Indeed, coupled with <a href="../services/vending-machine-maintenance/index.htm" title="">our service and maintenance plans</a>, your vending solutions should continue to function fault free for years to come. Nevertheless, sometimes, things can still go wrong.<br></p><p>Whether your machine has stopped vending or refuses to turn on, there’s no need to panic! There are plenty of understandable reasons why you may be experiencing problems and they don’t necessarily mean long periods of downtime. Here’s what to do if your vending machine has broken down.<br></p><p>First of all, you’ll need to identify the problem. Don’t forget the more obvious things like checking whether your machine is plugged in and turned on. You’d be surprised how many people have found themselves surprised by a faulty machine, only to realise they’d been hit by a tripped switch or power cut!<br></p><p>Still not working? Perhaps there’s a coin trapped in the payment system or your fans have stopped cooling, causing your machine to overheat? In the first instance, you’ll simply need to grab some tools, attempting to prise the offending currency out of the slot to begin vending again. The same applies to products that may be stuck in the dispensing mechanism. Provided that you can reach without causing damage with your tools, you should be able to address the problem yourself.<br></p><p>If you’re struggling to succeed or the issue is a bit more complex, however, you may need to ask for help. It’s important to take care not to damage your machine as you work – and gaining access by removing the front panel can be a daunting task.<br></p><p>If you’re not feeling confident or lack the skills of a knowledgeable electrician, we therefore recommend getting in touch with the professionals. They’ll be able to access the inside of your machine and assess the problem easily, checking for loose connections and replacing faulty parts as required. Plus, it’s always best to assess the cause of the breakdown, even if you did manage to remove that stubborn KitKat yourself! At Best Vending, the team carries most regular replacement parts in the van, allowing us to complete most repairs on the same day as our visit.<br></p><p>Whichever course of action you choose, please remember to switch your machine off and unplug it from the power supply prior to proceeding. This step protects you from electrical hazards and is therefore essential. Once again, if you’re unsure, it’s best to trust the professionals. You’ll save time and money in the long run.<br></p>

<div class="restrict-width">

		<div class="column full">
            		<p>School vending machines are a great way to supply staff and students alike with the drinks and snacks they need to get them through the day. Plus, when everything they need can be found on site, there’s less need for people to leave campus, resulting in fewer minutes lost and fewer dangers associated with pupils venturing unsupervised into the outside world.</p><p>If you think your school could benefit from a hot drinks machine, cold drinks machine or snack machine, there are several things you’ll need to do to ensure that installation is fully compliant.</p><p>Firstly, if you’re not in charge, you’ll need to check with the school administrators or head teacher. They might have certain policies regarding the use of vending machines and you’ll need to familiarise yourself with these, perhaps even pushing for change if they’re not convinced of the benefits of use . It might also help to present them with a breakdown of the costs they could save by installing vending machines, rather than keeping the school cafeteria open throughout the day, beyond the standard lunchtime hours.</p><p>Once you’ve obtained any necessary permissions, you’ll need to work out what kind of vending machines your school needs. Do you already have any vending machines installed? What kind of products could pupils benefit from? What other catering services do they currently have access to? If you’re still not sure, you can always contact the experts at Best Vending – we are always willing to provide free, impartial advice.</p><p>Next is acquiring your vending machines. We recommend using a fully managed vending service like Best Vending, as this ensures that you get high-quality school vending machines that are filled, cleaned and maintained for you, taking the stress and hassle out of providing drinks and snacks. The only thing you’ll need to do is develop your school’s vending machine policy, in order to determine the kind of products you would like us to supply and how much you would like to charge for each item. We even offer the option to ‘free vend’, which would mean that students could access essential items like bottled water for free, should you wish.</p><p>In addition to exploring the cost-effective purchase and rental options we have here at Best Vending, it might be worth finding out whether you are eligible for any funding or grants to put towards the cost. In any case, we aim to keep our pricing competitive and include installation with all orders, whether you prefer to buy or hire our machines.</p>

<div class="restrict-width">

		<div class="column full">
            		<p>The final price of your vending machine will depend on the type and size of the machine you choose and the capabilities and functions it comes with. Generally speaking, the larger or more complex your machine, the more it will cost. Nevertheless, choosing the right sized machine will save you money in the long run, as you won’t have to invest in additional machines to meet capacity later down the line. Likewise, choosing a machine with more modern functions, such as dual temperature control and a touchscreen, make it easier to stock the products you want and you won’t have to worry about replacing your machine when the technology becomes obsolete. For instance, people expect all vending machines to accept multiple payment methods rather than just coins nowadays, making a coin-only machine a poor choice, despite the lower cost.</p><p>At Best Vending, we take great pride in offering the highest-quality vending machines at competitive prices. We have both purchase and rental options available, meaning it’s easy to find the right vending machines for both your needs and your budget.</p>

<div class="restrict-width">

		<div class="column full">
            		<p>Vending machines can be found in a number of public places, from train stations and schools to shopping centres, hospitals and workplace offices. They’re an incredibly convenient way to purchase drinks and snacks when on the go, benefiting both customers and company owners, given that they can be operated easily without staff.</p><p>Indeed, the vending machine process is incredibly simple. Each machine will have a product selection panel, which may consist of a touch-button keypad or a touchscreen. Likewise, each product in the machine will have a number or code, along with the relevant pricing information. To purchase a product, the customer must simply insert the right amount of money – be it with coins, card or contactless – then enter the code of the product they want into the keypad. Provided that the right amount of money has been provided, the machine will then dispense the customer’s chosen product.</p><p>The exact way in which your vending machine dispenses products will depend on the type of machine you choose. Nevertheless, most operate on a conveyor system, driven by motors that push and rotate the selected item from the storage area inside. Your machine will also have sensors, which serve to detect whether or not the item has been successfully dispensed.</p><p>Vending machines are usually powered by electricity and must therefore be connected to the mains in order to work. In addition to powering the dispensing motor, this also provides energy for refrigeration, keeping perishable goods fresh and bottles and cans cold. There are now many energy-efficient vending machine models on the market, meaning there’s no need to worry about energy costs or environmental impact.</p><p>When you choose a vending machine from Best Vending, your machines will be cleaned, filled and maintained by us, meaning you won’t have to worry about restocking or repairs. We’ll also collect any funds from your machine and pay them into the bank on your behalf, should you wish. Conversely, if you opt for another service that isn’t fully managed, you will have to take care of all these things yourself and it’s essential that you don’t skip cleaning or regular inspections, as this could severely shorten your vending machine’s useful life.</p>

		<div class="column full">
            		<p>There are many different vending machine companies throughout the UK. Nevertheless, not all vending machines are made equal and not every vending machine company provides the same level of service.</p><p>We highly recommend looking for a company that only sells top-quality vending machines with the latest specs, best energy ratings and competitive prices. It’s also a good idea to look for a company that will deliver and install your machines for you.</p><p>Vending machines are designed to be convenient solutions, which is why you should also find a company that makes them convenient for you, as well as for your customers. At Best Vending, we offer a fully managed vending service, which means that, in addition to delivering and installing your chosen machines, we also clean, inspect, service and maintain them for you. What’s more, we’ll monitor stock levels for you, filling your machines up with your chosen drinks and snacks whenever required.</p><p>In addition to selling high-quality vending machines at competitive prices, we also offer several different long-term and short-term vending machine hire packages, allowing customers who don’t wish to purchase outright to access the latest machines – and turn an immediate profit from them – without the initial investment.</p>

<div class="restrict-width">

		<div class="column full">
            		<p>Yes. Most of the modern vending machines we supply here at Best Vending are Apple Pay enabled. In fact, provided that your chosen vending machines support contactless payments, people should be able to pay with all kinds of mobile wallets, from Apple Pay to Google Wallet. We highly recommend that all of our customers opt for this kind of machine, as it makes payment much more convenient for people using the machine, making it more likely that they will turn a higher profit from a greater number of transactions.</p><p>Apple Pay and other digital wallet services work using near-field communication (NFC) technology, which allows people to make contactless payments using their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and other portable devices.</p><p>To use Apple Pay or a similar payment service on a vending machine, simply hold your device close to the contactless reader to complete the transaction. You should receive a notification once your payment has been processed. Certain machines may have a limit on the amount you can spend in one transaction, although this isn’t usually a problem with vending machine purchases, which tend to consist of low-ticket items like food and drinks.</p>

<div class="restrict-width">

		<div class="column full">
            		<p>Some vending machines have cameras, but this is not a universal feature and it really depends on the specific machine and what it will be used for.</p><p>In some cases, vending machine companies may install cameras for security reasons – for instance, to deter theft or vandalism. They may also do so to monitor the machine’s inventory levels remotely, allowing them to restock the machines before they run low. These cameras may be visible or hidden, depending on why they were installed and where the machine is located.</p><p>It’s worth noting, however, that using cameras in vending machines may breach certain UK privacy laws and regulations. Generally speaking, camera use must be disclosed and consent must be obtained from the individuals being recorded. It’s therefore a good idea to check with your vending machine provider to see whether they have any camera-usage policies and procedures in place.</p><p>At Best Vending, we do all we can to ensure your machines are fully compliant, whilst going above and beyond to meet your every requirement.</p>

		<div class="column full">
            		<p>Whilst the ideal location for your vending machines will vary depending on the type of business or establishment you run, we have a few general tips on placing your vending machine for maximum results.</p><p>First of all, you’ll want to make sure your machines are placed in a busy location. For instance, it’s much better to leave them in waiting areas, busy halls or busy platforms than it is to place them in quiet corridors, where it may be difficult for people to find them. The more people that pass your vending machine, the more likely it is that you will make a profit.</p><p>You will also need to ensure that your chosen location is safe and secure. If possible, choose a well-lit area that’s monitored by security cameras (provided that the use thereof is legal). It’s also a good idea to position your machines in such a way that it’s difficult for thieves to tamper with them or steal the products inside.</p><p>Having said that, you don’t want to restrict access. It’s important to be able to refill your machines easily – and you’ll also need to be able to open them up without too much trouble should something go wrong. They will also need to be accessible for regular cleaning and maintenance.</p><p>Finally, think about the kind of products you’re selling and who you are serving. Gyms, airports and leisure centres with long queues are all great places to put drinks and snacks machines, as people are likely to be hungry and thirsty.</p><p>At Best Vending, we have over 40 years of experience supplying and fitting top-quality vending machines. As such, we are perfectly positioned to advise you on both your ideal machine and its placement, assessing the layout of your site before installing your chosen machines for you.</p>

            		<p>Yes, of course. It’s perfectly possible to place your vending machines outside. In fact, outdoor vending machines are incredibly common, be it in retail parks or at train stations, airports or local parks. Constructed from durable materials like stainless steel and aluminium, they’re specifically designed to resist water and weather damage, in addition to being able to withstand potential acts of vandalism. Indeed, many outdoor vending machines also boast reinforced glass, security cameras and alarms.</p><p>However, it's incredibly important to choose a machine with adequate insulation and temperature control, as this will protect perishable goods like food and drinks from the heat and cold.
